# Caprae Lead Processing Tool

This repository contains a simple lead‑processing pipeline designed for the Caprae Capital AI‑readiness pre‑screening challenge. The goal of the project is to demonstrate basic data preprocessing, lightweight lead scoring and personalised email generation while adhering to Caprae’s operator‑first ethos.

## Contents

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `lead_tool.py` | Python script that reads a raw lead CSV, removes duplicates, scores leads by title, revenue and industry, and generates personalised email templates. |
| `dataset.csv` | Sample dataset of 15 mock leads (including some duplicates) used to demonstrate the tool. |
| `processed_leads.csv` | Output generated by running the tool on the sample dataset. Contains scores and email templates. |
| `report.md` | One‑page report explaining the rationale behind the tool, data preprocessing steps, scoring methodology and alignment with Caprae’s mission. |


## Setup

This project requires Python 3.8 or later. To install dependencies (standard library only), clone this repository and create a virtual environment if desired:

```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install --upgrade pip
```

No external packages are required—the script relies only on the Python standard library.

## Usage

To process the sample dataset and produce a scored CSV with personalised emails, run:

```sh
python lead_tool.py --input dataset.csv --output processed_leads.csv
```

The script will:

1. Read the input CSV into `Lead` objects.
2. Remove duplicate records based on the `email` field (keeping the first occurrence).
3. Compute a heuristic score for each lead based on their job title, company revenue and industry.
4. Generate a personalised email template for each contact.
5. Write the results to the output CSV and print a brief summary to the console.

You can modify the input and output file paths using the `--input` and `--output` flags. To extend or refine the scoring model, edit the `_score_title`, `_score_revenue` and `_score_industry` functions in `lead_tool.py`.



## Running via PowerShell

If you are on Windows, you can run the tool from a PowerShell prompt. First, ensure Python is installed and available on your system. Then navigate to the project directory and execute:

```powershell
python .\lead_tool.py --input .\dataset.csv --output .\processed_leads.csv
```

PowerShell will display a summary of the processed leads. The output file (`processed_leads.csv`) will be created in the same directory.
