"""
lead_tool.py
===============

This script processes a CSV of raw leads, removes duplicates, computes a simple
lead score based on heuristics, and generates a personalised outreach email for
each contact. The output is written to a new CSV with additional columns for
score and email template. A summary of the results is printed to the console.

Usage:
    python lead_tool.py --input dataset.csv --output processed_leads.csv

The input CSV is expected to have the following columns:

    first_name,last_name,company_name,title,revenue,industry,email

Revenue should be expressed either as a numeric string (e.g. "1000000")
representing annual revenue in USD, or as a descriptor such as "small",
"medium", or "large".

The script will deduplicate rows based on the email address. If an email
appears more than once in the input file, only the first occurrence is kept.

The lead score is calculated as the sum of individual subscores:

* Title score: High-ranking roles (e.g. CEO, CFO, CTO) receive more points.
* Revenue score: Larger companies receive more points.
* Industry score: Certain industries may be weighted higher based on
  typical value to Caprae Capital.

You can extend or modify the scoring logic by editing the `_score_title`,
`_score_revenue`, and `_score_industry` functions below.
